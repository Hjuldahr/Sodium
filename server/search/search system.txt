* (leading or trailing wildcard)

(_&_) (intersect set)
(_|_) (union set)

space delimited, filters applied left to right sequentially

ex: "user:hjuldahr time:<20260114 genre:fantasy species:-(fox|wolf)"
Search for posts by the user 'hjuldahr' posted after the timestamp 20260114 in the fantasy genre not featuring foxes or wolves

ex: "post:#10339"
ex: "post.id:10339" id is implicit when using #_
Search for this post ID specifically 

ex: "character:!(karishad&keene_milton)"
Search for posts featuring only these two characters

ex: "character:*(housepets)"
ex: "character.label:*(housepets)" label is implicit by default
Include any character that has the Housepets comic disambiguation (added manually by a user in parentheses)

Ideally, it should work for most DB columns (i.e. "tag.popularity:>100" or "tag.shunning:<10" either can filter out controversial tags by their attributes)
